## Project Description
This project contains a basic artificial intelligence that uses state tree and perception component to interact with the environment.

The state tree is used to manage the AI agent's behavior. The perception component is used to sense the environment and provide feedback to the AI agent.

## Usage
This project is meant to be used as a template or starting point for creating more advanced AI systems. The state tree and perception systems can be customized and expanded upon to create more complex and dynamic AI behaviors.
